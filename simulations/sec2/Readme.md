This is the working directory. The main file is "run.R", the code files are "basic.R", "comparemu.R", "compareQ.R", and "comparesigma.R". 

Run the code and "compareunknown.R" and get results for Appendix A.2.

The file readasymp.R will analyze the stored results from the code above and store the analyzed results into the folder asymp.

The optimizediagQ.R and optimizefullQ.R correspond to Appendix A.3. 

All the python files here are written to plot the figures in the paper.


Expected time:

"basic.R", 3h

"comparemu.R", 4h

"compareQ.R", 4h
 
"comparesigma.R", 4h
 
"compareunknown.R", 4h
