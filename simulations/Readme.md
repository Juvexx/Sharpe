Sec 2 refers to the simulation Section 4.1 and additional results to validate theory in Section 2, and Sec 3 refers to the simulation Section 4.2 and additional results to validate theory in Section 3. They share the same assets.


In Section 2, you can directly run 'Compareunknown.R', 'Comparemu.R', 'CompareQ.R', 'CompareSigma.R' and 'basic.R' to obtain the simulation results under 1000 repetitions.

In Section 3, you can directly run 'basic.R' and 'mucase.R' to obtain the simulation results.
